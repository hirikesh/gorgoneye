The eye gaze tracking system allows users to replicate the function of that a computer mouse. In other words, it will enable users to use their eyes to open, navigate, and close specific programs in a computer desktop environment. An important application includes enabling accessibility of desktop environments to those with physical disabilities preventing them from the comfortable use of a computer with a conventional keyboard and mouse. The system aims to be implemented using simple and inexpensive equipment (ie. consisting of a basic webcam and IR sensors) so that cost is not a barrier to usage.

Furthermore, this system will be demonstrated with a simple user interface that is designed to be more intuitive and appropriate to navigation using eyes through the desktop environment. The system will also feature head tracking in order to improve the robustness of eye tracking, as well as enabling the interface to change or evolve with the personâ€™s head movements, allowing for a visually interactive experience.
